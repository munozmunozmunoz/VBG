This branch follows the development of a capture-recapture von Bertalanffy growth model that includes what individual categorical covariate, a seasonally varying growth coefficient, and environmental covariates (temperature).

There are 2052 observations. Each observation is a time interval between capture and recapture, the lengths at both ocassions, the number of warm season days, the number of cool season days, and the mean temperature during the entire time interval.
